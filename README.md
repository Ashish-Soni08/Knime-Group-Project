## 🎯 Project Objective

Predict whether a patient will survive diagnosed liver cancer based on clinical and laboratory parameters.

- **Positive (1)**: Patient Survives
- **Negative (0)**: Death

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Total Instances**: 165 patients
- **Total Attributes**: 49 features + 1 class attribute
- **Feature Types**: 24 nominal features with binary values
- **Data Quality Challenge**: Only 8 patients have complete data

## 🔍 Data Understanding

### Key Findings
- Significant missing data: Only 8 patients with complete records
- Non-ignorable missing values
- No semantic or syntactic errors detected
- Correlation analysis performed with threshold of 0.7

### Data Characteristics
The dataset exhibits patterns in:
- Age at diagnosis vs. Gender
- Grams of alcohol per day vs. Oxygen saturation
- Major dimension of nodules (cm) vs. Haemoglobin

## 🛠️ Data Preparation Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Outlier Treatment**: Closely permitted value approach
- **Missing Value Substitution**: 
  - Median for numerical features
  - Most frequent value for categorical features
- **Feature Reduction**: Removed columns with >60% missing values

### 2. Feature Selection
Applied forward feature selection technique to identify the most predictive attributes.

#### Selected Features (7 attributes achieving ~79% accuracy)
1. **Hepatitis B Core Antibody**
2. **Hepatitis C Virus Antibody**
3. **Endemic Countries**
4. **International Normalized Ratio (INR)**
5. **Ascites Degree**
6. **Alpha-Fetoprotein (ng/mL)**
7. **Mean Corpuscular Volume (fl)**
8. **Alkaline Phosphatase (U/L)**

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

### Algorithm
- **Model**: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Validation**: 10-Fold Cross-Validation

### Rationale
Naive Bayes was selected due to:
- Effectiveness with small datasets
- Robustness to missing data after preprocessing
- Good performance with binary classification problems
- Computational efficiency

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: ~77%
- **Key Finding**: 7 attributes are sufficient to classify patient survival outcomes

### Limitations
- Small dataset size (165 instances)
- High percentage of missing values
- Achieving higher accuracy is challenging given data constraints
